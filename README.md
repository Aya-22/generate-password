# generate-password

## The main focus of this project is to use JavaScript to generate a random password using upper case and lower case characters, special characters, and numbers.

The first step taken to ahcieve my goal was to create an object with a set of arrays for each character in my password. I struggled at first with this portion becuase I used arrays and strings for different characters. I then decided to create an object with various arrays. My next step was the generatePassword function which incluces various variables, if statments, and a for loop. This portion was difficult becuase I understood what was need but it was difficult to put into code. I understood the process once I discussed the assignment with my tutor, class mates, and TJ. I understand now that I need to think in a logical mindset.
